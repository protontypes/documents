The Old English, also known as blackletter, dates back to 1000 years ago when it was used as a script throughout Western Europe. It should be noted that Old English or blackletter has nothing to do with old English language nor the old English language written with blackletter. Various forms of blackletter exist, mainly including Textualis, the most calligraphic form of blackletter; Schwabacher, an old English form that was heavily used in the early German print typefaces; Fraktur, the most common German blackletter typeface.

The Old English font, according to Wikipedia, is a revival of William Caslonâ€™s typeface Caslon Black. The style is characterized by its engraving look. The distinguished look and historic sensation make it extremely popular in advertising, invitations, greeting cards and wherever a formal hand-lettered or engraved look is desired. The old English font is also used a lot in text tattoo designs. Due to its intricate appearance, it is very hard to draw with freehand. New Old English designed by K-Type is a typical font family of old English style. The font was inspired by two Victorian coins which featured a gothic script lowercase with quite modern looking.
