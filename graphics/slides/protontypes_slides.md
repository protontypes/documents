# Software defined decentralized donation 

---

# Open Software needs decentralized funding designed by collective people.  

# So what's this random donation and how does it work? 

---

# And who decides whats the metric?

---

# How do I get paid as a maintainer or contributer?

---

# How do it get in contact with the people involved in my code? 

---

# How do we keep the payment secure?
