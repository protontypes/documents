# Why is Nuclear Energy not sustainable?

This post should answer the question why we think Nuclear Energy is not an open and sustainable technology and is therefore not included on our [Open Sustainable Technologies list](https://opensustain.tech/).
From [previous](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25217989) [encounters](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/jdl5s8/open_source_projects_to_sustain_stable_climate/) with this question and the following discussion we took it upon us to derive a reasonable explanation to help along future discourses about this.

We explain what we define as _open_ and _sustainable_.

## What is open and sustainable?

And what does in mean?

### Open Technologies

We derive our understanding of _Open Source_ mainly from the [definition of Open Source](https://opensource.org/osd) by the Open Source Initiative.
This definition focuses on sofware and source code and software.
Additionally, we build on the [Open Source Hardware (OSHW) Statement of Principles](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/).
_Technology_ consists for us of both software and hardware (electric and mechanical hardware designs).

Looking at the definitions mentioned above we can evaluate if a project is open source:

1. The used license does not restrict any party from distributing the source code or files. Furthermore, the used license does not require any form of payment.
2. The source code or documentation (CAD files, technical drawings, etc.) are easily available.
3. Aforementioned source code and/or documentation can be modified.
4.

### Sustainable Technologies

* Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

## Now what about Nuclear Energy?

### Open NE

* We looked, but didn't fint anything
* Maybe like three projects so far

### Sustainable NE


## Nuclear Stigma

Is NE stigmatized?

# More Talking Points

While it is true, that the generation of heat for the steam generator produces no greenhouse gases and other issues,
the surrounding infrastructure cannot provide the same.

* Produktion of fuel not renewable?
* not renewable in itself, therefore not sustainable in the long run?
* waste problem
  * where to store safely
  * what about earlier waste?
  * what time scale is to be viewed?
    * climate change: next 100 years relevant
    * nuclear waste: 1000s of years (even problems with how to mark waste as dangerous, see color changing cats)
* safety
  * admittedly, a lot of panic here
  * real dangers: waste, malfunctions, human error
* centralisation vs decentralisation in the aspect of sustainability

# Writing Notes

* historical issues
* technology is not free
* strong military interest / missbrauch
* centralisation, can only be managed by licensed institutions
* not all countries are allowed to produce nuclear energy
* safety issues
* hazard analysis
  * Wahrschenlichkeit die sich bisher ergeben hat -> skalieren auf "die Welt verwendet nukleare Energie"
* ITER (recherche dazu)
