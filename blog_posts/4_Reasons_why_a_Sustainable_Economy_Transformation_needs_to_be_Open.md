# 4 Reasons why a Sustainable Economy Transformation needs to be Open

> Probleme kann man niemals mit derselben Denkweise l√∂sen, durch die sie entstanden sind. (Albert Einstein)

A sustainable transformation of our economy is an inevitable process that will challenge an entire generation. Open source and open principles play a crucial role in this transformation. Here are 4 reasons why a sustainable transformation must be open:

### Transparency, Trust and Reproducibility 

Economic and global change in the use of environmental resources requires a common understanding of how our actions affect the environment. It is about the question which human action and technology is sustainable for the environment in the long term. These questions that at first seem simple to answer in this context are in fact incredibly complex. Can biofuel be an alternative for fossil fuel? Is hydrogen better suited than batteries for the storage of renewable energy?  Will autonomous vehicles create more or less traffic? 

Open principles in the search for answers to these questions can be crucial to ensure trust and responsibility. Open Datasets, Simulation Models and Open Access can create a global discussion without running the risk of being covertly influenced by individual interests. Multiple open climate models and datasets have already created a global scientific consensus on the human impact on climate change. The answer to the question of how we can stop this development is at least as complex as the basic understanding of the context of climate change. Life cycle assessments play a central role in this. With the help of public data and open models, it is possible for business to create transparency in the environmental footprint for there products . This ensures widespread trust in sustainable consumer behavior.
